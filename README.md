Task:
Convert Python Script to Rust and compare exeution performance.

Requirements

Package a Python script with setuptools or a similar tool
Include a user guide on how to install and use the tool
Include communication with an external or internal database (NoSQL, SQL, etc) [If you use Rust you can skip the DB part]

Deliverables

Rust and Python scripts 
Performance comparison report (PDF or markdown)

Performance:
The execution time for the Python script is approximately 2.7894973754882812e-05 seconds, and the execution time for the Rust script is 0.000054311 seconds. When we compare the two values, we find that the Rust script has a slightly higher execution time than the Python script.


See the report:

Python to Rust

This Python version creates a random fruit salad with two servings of figs using a custom class Fruit that defines the comparison logic. The heapq module is utilized to maintain the priority queue based on the defined comparison logic. The final fruit salad is printed with the servings of figs appearing first.

The execution time for the Python script is approximately 2.7894973754882812e-05 seconds, and the execution time for the Rust script is 0.000054311 seconds. When we compare the two values, we find that the Rust script has a slightly higher execution time than the Python script.
